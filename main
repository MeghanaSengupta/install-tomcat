***See which packages are available in your repos, just for info
yum search tomcat
***Install tomcat and tomcat-admin-webapps
tomcat-admin-webapp is a separate package that you have to install along with tomcat if you need a nice GUI to manage tomcat and deploy apps via GUI.

sudo yum install tomcat tomcat-admin-webapps
****Note 1: Amazon Linux 2 doesn't even come with java. Required java version will be installed as it is a dependency for tomcat.

Note 2: Tomcat is installed in /usr/share/tomcat folder.

***Make manager app accessible from everywhere
By default the manager webapp is restricted to the host in which tomcat is installed. Lets make it accessible from anywhere.

sudo nano /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

***Add the following line inside the <context> tag:

<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow="^.*$" />


***Create the user: admin

By default no users are created for the tomcat. Lets create an admin user:

sudo nano /usr/share/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
Add the following lines inside <tomcat-users> tag:

<role rolename="admin"/> 
<role rolename="admin-gui"/> 
<role rolename="admin-script"/> 
<role rolename="manager"/> 
<role rolename="manager-gui"/> 
<role rolename="manager-script"/> 
<role rolename="manager-jmx"/> 
<role rolename="manager-status"/> 
<user name="admin" password="adminadmin" roles="admin,manager,admin-gui,admin-script,manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status" />


***Open ports in firewall
In the security group of your ec2 instance make sure you open port 8080.

***To start Tomcat
sudo systemctl start tomcat.service

***check of the status of the tomcat service
sudo service tomcat status -l

***You can also check what ports are open and listening in your server
sudo netstat -ntlp | grep LISTEN
you can find 8080 listening
 

Access the manager webUI
Go to

<ec2-instance-public-IP>:8080/manager/html
18.133.73.34:8080/manager/html

Login with the credentials given when you created the admin user

To stop tomcat
